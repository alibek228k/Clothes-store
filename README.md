# Clothes-store
Description: This project was developed for the Coding Lab. This project was created to be used by people. So that people could just find the right things for themselves. Since nowadays it is very difficult to find suitable clothes for yourself. And sometimes the search for a quality product takes a very long amount of time. And of course, this will affect our project on the good side. The site has 10 pages: home(main) page, page for men, page for women, page for kids, about us, payment, registration and login, location and shopping cart. Each page on our site has a header and footer. We used bootstrap for the header, and we placed brands of clothing in the footer. On the home page of our site, we used a bootstrap carousel, as well as a scrolling and item card. Pages of men, women, kids are very similar there posted a catalog of clothes
